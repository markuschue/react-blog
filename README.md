# Blog with MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js

## Description

This is a blog application that uses MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, among other libraries.
The application is a simple blog that allows users to create posts, edit posts, and delete posts.
Currently, the application is not deployed, but it can be run locally.
The objective of this project is to learn how to develop a full-stack application using the MERN stack.
This project is based on the [MERN Boilerplate](https://github.com/markuschue/mern-boilerplate).

## Installation
To start the application, you need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed.
Then, you need to install the dependencies for the server and the client running the following commands in the root directory of the project:

    npm install
    cd client
    npm install
    cd api
    npm install
    cd ..

Then, you need to start the server and the client running `npm run dev` in the root directory of the project.
